# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project focuses on introducing and practicing C programming concepts such as variables, if statements, and while loops. It covers a variety of tasks designed to enhance your understanding of these fundamental elements.

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- [0-positive_or_negative.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)
- Write a C program to print whether a random number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit
- [1-last_digit.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
- Create a C program to print the last digit of a random number.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- [2-print_alphabet.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)
- Implement a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet.

### 3. alphABET
- [3-print_alphabets.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)
- Write a C program that prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets.

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- [4-print_alphabt.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)
- Develop a C program to print the lowercase alphabet without the letters 'q' and 'e'.

### 5. Numbers
- [5-print_numbers.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)
- Create a C program to print single-digit numbers from 0 to 9.

### 6. Numberz
- [6-print_numberz.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
- Write a C program to print single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 without using char variables.

### 7. Smile in the mirror
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)
- Implement a C program to print the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

### 8. Hexadecimal
- [8-print_base16.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)
- Create a C program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- [9-print_comb.c](file://0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)
- Write a C program to print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
